Add Column â€“ Usage Example for Simulated add_column Function

Description:
This usage example visually demonstrates the concept of adding columns with varying widths using SplashKit. While the add_column function is not directly available in the SplashKit API for C++ and Python, this example simulates the behavior by drawing rectangles representing columns and labeling them appropriately.

Each implementation (C++, Python, and C#) displays three columns labeled "Small", "Medium", and "Large", with different widths. This visually demonstrates how content can be organized in columnar layouts.

Expected Output:
A window will open (600x400) with a white background.
You will see three columns displayed side by side:

    The first column labeled "Small" with a width of 100 pixels.

    The second column labeled "Medium" with a width of 200 pixels.

    The third column labeled "Large" with a width of 300 pixels.

Each column is filled with a light gray color, outlined with a black border, and has its label displayed near the top. The columns are horizontally aligned starting from the left side of the window.

The program remains open until the window is manually closed.
