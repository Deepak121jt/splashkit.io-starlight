Vector Field Visualisation â€“ Usage Example for line_from(Point2D, Vector2D)

Description:
-------------
This usage example demonstrates the SplashKit function `line_from(Point2D, Vector2D)`, which creates a line starting at a given point and extending in the direction of a vector offset.

Each implementation (C++, Python, and C#) draws a grid of green vectors across the screen. These vectors visually represent the same directional offset from various origin points across the window, forming a vector field.

How to Run:
-------------
Ensure you have SplashKit installed for your language of choice.

For Python:
1. Save the file as `line_from_vector.py`
2. Open terminal and run:
   $ skm python3 line_from_vector.py

For C++:
1. Save the file as `line_from_vector.cpp`
2. Compile and run using:
   $ skm cpp run line_from_vector.cpp

For C#:
1. Save the file as `LineFromVector.cs`
2. Run using:
   $ skm csharp run LineFromVector.cs

Expected Output:
-----------------
A window will open (800x600) with a white background.
You will see a grid of green lines across the screen.
Each line starts at a grid point and points in the same direction (20 units right, 10 units down), showing how `line_from` applies a vector offset to draw a consistent directional field.

The window will automatically close after 5 seconds.
